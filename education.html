</body>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px; width: 95%; color: white;">
	 Everyone has different life challenges and experiences.
	 From there we are tested whether to be a better person or vice versa. 
	 From a young age, I like to participate in various activities or programs, 
	 including being involved as a participant in volunteer activities, military camps,
	 prayer camps, camping, and any program that is beneficial. 
	 Once I started growing up as a teenager, I started getting involved in leadership and program management including being the program chairman, secretary, facilitator, committee member and so on. </p>

	 Next, when I started growing up,  I used to work as a kindergarten teacher at Albaghdadi Playtime Center Kindergarten for a year. My experience there for a few months made me more patient and knew the right way to teach and handle children. Honestly, teaching children is more difficult than I imagined, especially in teaching the letters of the Al-Quran. Still, it was a lot of fun and I really enjoyed teaching them. My previous colleagues and employers were also very positive and helped me a lot. Next, I need to continue my Diploma studies at UITM Machang in the field of information management. But, at the same time, I also involved myself in business to find new experiences and income. I have started a cosmetics business, Marykay. In addition, I also often live in tiktok to get to know more people and find new customers. I'm just opened a tiktok account and have gained 1200 followers. My followers at tiktok are very friendly and supportive. They also give gifts and the gift can be exchanged for money.

	 Besides, im also doing a bakery business. I sell banana cake and batik cake. My experience in doing business is to make myself more patient and strong in facing various challenges. It is not easy to gain the trust of customers and it takes a long time. In addition, each different taste also raises criticism that they are not satisfied after buying our products. However, I did not give up and continued to strive despite being often rejected because I believe that failure is also a ladder of success. For me, we need to always take the opportunity to upgrade ourselves in order to be better and more skilled in many areas. Every experience makes us great people and always grateful.
