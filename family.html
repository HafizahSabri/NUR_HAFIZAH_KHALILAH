    I was born into a modest family. It never feels too hard or too easy, and sometimes quite luxurious especially in terms of food sources. My parents have educated us siblings with the nature of always being grateful so that we always feel enough. My father's name is Sabri Abdullah. He works as a lecturer at mtq, panji. Prior to this, he was an imam at the al-sultan ismail petra mosque, kubang kerian and had served there for 20 years. However, for some reason he was transferred to work at mtq, panji. My mother's name is Wahidah Abdullah and is a full time housewife. My mother is a very loving, patient, sporting, good listener, good at cooking and much more. To be honest, my mom and dad were indeed perfect in my eyes.<br>

    <br><p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; color: white;">
    In addition, I am the third child of six siblings. My eldest sister's name Nor Hafizah Khairiah, the second one is Umar Al-faruq, followed by my younger brother, Umar Abdul Rahman, Umar Abdul Aziz and lastly, Nur Hafizah Karimah. My eldest sister is a graduate of the University of Malaya and now works as a kafa teacher at sk mentera. In addition, my brother is pursuing a degree at OUM and he is married to his heart's desire, Nur Sahira Ezrin. My younger brother who is the fourth child is working at Hotel H elite as a gym manager. In addition, my next brother is studying at Maahad Tahfiz Sulaimaniyah, Tumpat. Lastly, my youngest sister is currently studying at Sekolah Kebangsaan Kubang Kerian 1 which is also my former school.</p> </div>
