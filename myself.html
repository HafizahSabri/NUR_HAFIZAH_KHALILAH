        	    Assalamualaikum and hi to the readers, I am fizah .. A very <i>cheerful and approachable</i> person, loves challenges, loves finding new experiences, and a positive person. For me, a positive circle can make us a positive person, so we should stay away from a negative circle. The table above only shows about my personal information, but maybe this little writing will make you know me better. <br>I want to share with you about the life I have gone through. Before this, I lived in 'Ketereh' and have now moved to 'Pasir Tumbuh'. Memories of my childhood are all in 'Ketereh'. Our life used to be a bit harder than it is now. Still, all I can say is, I really enjoyed my childhood. An age full of fun, without gadgets, without social media and so on. <br>But now, I have stepped into adulthood. More and more responsibilities and trusts have to be shouldered. Besides, our lives are much better now. Now, I am a UITM diploma student in information management and will be pursuing a degree in the same field. Next, I also join marykay's business to find side income and save for the future. Next, im also have some hobbies and my leisure activities are mostly watching action or inspired movies on netflix or watching anime. <b>One Piece</b> is one of my favorite anime because the story teaches a lot and has a lot to do with family, friendships, life experiences, memories and more. Apart from that, I also love extreme activities such as horseback riding, hiking, archery, Atv sports and others..
